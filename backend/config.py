"""
If results show:

1. Too many false positives (incorrect words considered correct):
   - Increase WORD_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD to 0.8
   - Increase SEGMENT_SCORE_THRESHOLD to 0.55

2. Too many false negatives (correct words considered incorrect):
   - Decrease WORD_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD to 0.7
   - Decrease SEGMENT_SCORE_THRESHOLD to 0.45
   
3. Tracking loses position frequently:
   - Increase TRACKING_WINDOW_SIZE to 80
   - Increase BACKWARD_MARGIN to 20
   - Decrease CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD to 0.3

4. Silence is processed as audio:
   - Increase MIN_AUDIO_ENERGY to 0.02 or 0.03

5. Real audio is rejected:
   - Decrease MIN_AUDIO_ENERGY to 0.005

6. Processing is slow:
   - Reduce TRACKING_WINDOW_SIZE to 40
   - Reduce MAX_SEGMENT_WORDS to 20

7. Want to use local ASR instead of cloud API:
   - Change ASR_BACKEND to "nemo"
   - Ensure NEMO_MODEL_PATH points to valid .nemo model file
   - GPU with CUDA highly recommended for real-time performance

8. NeMo ASR is slow:
   - Ensure CUDA is available (check logs for "Model loaded on CUDA")
   - If running on CPU, consider switching back to "whisper" for better latency
